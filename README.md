This study introduces a new approach to ECG signal analysis, utilizing classical signal processing techniques without machine learning models.
The method uses time-domain features like R-R intervals and heart rate, along with frequency-domain features like spectral entropy, to detect various cardiac conditions. 
The research uses data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The method successfully identifies significant cardiac patterns, 
offering practical implications for automated ECG interpretation and telemedicine applications. 
The study suggests further improvements in classification accuracy by exploring larger datasets and additional features, 
contributing to the ongoing evolution of ECG analysis methodologies.
